In today's fast-paced and competitive job market, the process of screening resumes can be a time-consuming
and labor-intensive task for recruiters and hiring managers. Traditional resume screening often involves 
manually sorting through numerous applications to identify candidates who meet specific qualifications and 
experience criteria. This method can be subjective, prone to human bias, and limited in its ability to process 
large volumes of resumes efficiently.
The micro project on resume screening seeks to address these challenges by developing an automated system
that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to categorize resumes according
to predefined job categories. The project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the hiring process by 
quickly filtering out resumes that do not meet the required job criteria and identifying the most suitable 
candidates for further evaluation.
